# SSRF 

> SSRF stands for Server-Side Request Forgery. 

It's a vulnerability that allows a malicious user to cause the webserver to make an additional or edited HTTP request to the resource of the attacker's choosing. 

## Types of SSRF

There are two types of SSRF vulnerability; the first is a regular SSRF where data is returned to the attacker's screen. The second is a Blind SSRF vulnerability where an SSRF occurs, but no information is returned to the attacker's screen.

## What's the impact?

A successful SSRF attack can result in any of the following: 

    Access to unauthorised areas.
    Access to customer/organisational data.
    Ability to Scale to internal networks.
    Reveal authentication tokens/credentials.
